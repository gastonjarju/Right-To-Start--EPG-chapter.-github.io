             <p>Since connections are essential to a thriving community, our team in EPG will be focusing on virtually connecting all levels of this community, including novice entrepreneurs with the drive to start something new with civic leaders, supporters, coaches, and even retirees with a knowledge base looking to pass down their education to the new generations.
               We are starting this venture by hosting Start-Warming Parties sometime in August to showcase these individuals and get them connected to the community members willing to help. These Start-Warmers are not directed to a particular sector of innovation, but to all in the community, as this aligns with Victor’s vision that we never know who the next big innovator will be, while also not knowing who will be their best supporters!</p>

            <h2 style="align:center; color:#ffa41b"><b>How can you help?</b></h2>
             <p>Victor Hwang promotes the idea that “1000 = 3 + 997” which means that out of every 1000 people, about 3 of them will try to start a new venture.
             However, the whole of the 1000 also contains the other 997. He supports the evidence that the 997 are essential to the empowerment of the 3, and
              that without each and every individual, a small community cannot continue to prosper and innovate. This means that you are part of that 1000,
              whether you consider yourself a starter, a supporter, or just an advocate with valuable insights, concerns, and knowledge.</p>

                <h2 style="align:center; color:#ffa41b"><b>Why this matters?</b></h2>
                 <p>As Victor W. Hwang puts it, “It’s in those individualized economies-instead of the macro economy-where real lives are
                 lived, where we also find hope.” Thus,we hope that you will join us in the fight to break the barriers that “small” businesses encounter.
